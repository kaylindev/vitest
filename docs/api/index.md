# API Reference

The following types are used in the type signatures below

```ts
type DoneCallback = (error?: any) => void
type Awaitable<T> = T | PromiseLike<T>
type TestFunction = () => Awaitable<void> | (done: DoneCallback) => void
```

When a test function returns a promise, the runner will await until it is resolved to collect async expectations. If the promise is rejected, the test will fail.

For compatibility with Jest, `TestFunction` can also be of type `(done: DoneCallback) => void`. If this form is used, the test will not be concluded until `done` is called (with zero arguments or a falsy value for a successful test, and with an truthy error value as argument to trigger a fail). We don't recommend to use this form, as you can achieve the same using an `async` function.

## test

`test` defines a set of related expectations. Default timeout for tests is 5 seconds, and can be configured globally with [testTimeout](../config/#testtimeout).

**Type:** `(name: string, fn: TestFunction, timeout?: number) => void`
**Alias:** `it`

```ts
import { test, expect } from 'vitest'

test('should work as expected', () => {
  expect(Math.sqrt(4)).toBe(2);
})
```

### test.skip

Use `.skip` to avoid running certain tests

**Type:** `(name: string, fn: TestFunction, timeout?: number) => void`

```ts
test.skip("skipped test", () => {
  // Test skipped, no error
  assert.equal(Math.sqrt(4), 3);
});
```

### test.only

Use `.only` to only run certain tests in a given suite 

**Type:** `(name: string, fn: TestFunction, timeout?: number) => void`

```ts
test.only("test", () => {
    // Only this test (and others marked with only) are run
    assert.equal(Math.sqrt(4), 2);
  });
});
```

### test.concurrent

`.concurrent` marks consecutive tests to be run them in parallel. It receives the test name, an async function with the tests to collect, and an optional timeout (in milliseconds).

**Type:** `(name: string, fn: TestFunction, timeout?: number) => void`

```ts
// The two tests marked with concurrent will be run in parallel
describe("suite", () => {
  test("serial test", async() => { /* ... */ });
  test.concurrent("concurrent test 1", async() => { /* ... */ });
  test.concurrent("concurrent test 2", async() => { /* ... */ });
});
```

`.skip`, `.only`, and `.todo` works with concurrent tests. All the following combinations are valid:

```ts
test.concurrent(...)
test.skip.concurrent(...), test.concurrent.skip(...)
test.only.concurrent(...), test.concurrent.only(...)
test.todo.concurrent(...), test.concurrent.todo(...)
```

### test.todo

Use `.todo` to stub tests to be implemented later

**Type:** `(name: string) => void`

```ts
// An entry will be shown in the report for this test
test.todo("unimplemented test");
```

## describe

When you use `test` in the top level of file, they are collected as part of the implicit suite for it. Using `describe` you can define a new suite in the current context, as a set of related tests and other nested suites. A suite lets you organize your tests so reports are more clear.

### describe.skip

Use `.skip` in a suite to avoid avoid running it

**Type:** `(name: string, fn: TestFunction, timeout?: number) => void`

```ts
describe.skip("skipped suite", () => {
  test("sqrt", () => {
    // Suite skipped, no error
    assert.equal(Math.sqrt(4), 3);
  });
});
```

### describe.only

Use `.only` to only run certain suites

**Type:** `(name: string, fn: TestFunction, timeout?: number) => void`

```ts
// Only this suite (and others marked with only) are run
describe.only("suite", () => {
  test("sqrt", () => {
    assert.equal(Math.sqrt(4), 3);
  });
});
```

### describe.concurrent

`.concurrent` in a suite marks every tests as concurrent

**Type:** `(name: string, fn: TestFunction, timeout?: number) => void`

```ts
// All tests within this suite will be run in parallel
describe.concurrent("suite", () => {
  test("concurrent test 1", async() => { /* ... */ });
  test("concurrent test 2", async() => { /* ... */ });
  test.concurrent("concurrent test 3", async() => { /* ... */ });
});
```

`.skip`, `.only`, and `.todo` works with concurrent suites. All the following combinations are valid:

```ts
describe.concurrent(...)
describe.skip.concurrent(...), describe.concurrent.skip(...)
describe.only.concurrent(...), describe.concurrent.only(...)
describe.todo.concurrent(...), describe.concurrent.todo(...)
```

### describe.todo

Use `.todo` to stub suites to be implemented later

**Type:** `(name: string) => void`

```ts
// An entry will be shown in the report for this suite
describe.todo("unimplemented suite");
```

## Setup and Teardown

These global functions allows you to hook into the life cycle of tests to avoid repeating setup and teardown code. They apply to the current context: the file if they are used at the top-level or the current suite if they are inside a `describe` block.

### beforeEach

Register a callback to be called before each test in the current context.

**Type:** `beforeEach(fn: () => Awaitable<void>, timeout: number)`

### afterEach

Register a callback to be called after each test in the current context.

**Type:** `afterEach(fn: () => Awaitable<void>, timeout: number)`

### beforeAll

Register a callback to be called once before starting to run all tests in the current context.

**Type:** `beforeAll(fn: () => Awaitable<void>, timeout: number)`

### afterAll

Register a callback to be called once after all tests have run in the current context.

**Type:** `afterAll(fn: () => Awaitable<void>, timeout: number)`
