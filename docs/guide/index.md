## Trying Vite Online

You can try Vitest online on [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/node-u5kp1f?file=test%2Fsuite.test.ts). It runs Vitest directly in the browser, and it is almost identical to the local setup but doesn't require installing anything on your machine.

## Adding Vitest to your Project

```bash
$ npm add vitest
```

## Command Line Interface

In a project where Vitest is installed, you can use the `vitest` binary in your npm scripts, or run it directly with `npx vitest`. Here is the default npm scripts in a scaffolded Vite project:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```json5
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest",
    "coverage": "vitest --coverage"
  }
}
```

You can specify additional CLI options like `--port` or `--https`. For a full list of CLI options, run `npx vite --help` in your project.

## Using Unreleased Commits

If you can't wait for a new release to test the latest features, you will need to clone the [vitest repo](https://github.com/antfu-sponsors/vitest) to your local machine and then build and link it yourself ([pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) is required):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/antfu-sponsors/vitest.git
cd vite
pnpm install
cd packages/vite
pnpm run build
pnpm link --global # you can use your preferred package manager for this step
```

Then go to the project where you are using Vitest and run `pnpm link --global vite` (or the package manager that you used to link `vitest` globally).
